# ozone
We employed this novel and pragmatic peel analysis model on US EPAâ€™s Air Quality Dataset of ground-level ozone. After employing multiple data-science approaches (ARMA-ARIMA, HMM) and filters (Moving Average, Savitzky-Golay), we analyzed aftermath of the region (rural or urban) and week (weekends or weekdays) on ground-level ozone pollution and variation in its precursors.
